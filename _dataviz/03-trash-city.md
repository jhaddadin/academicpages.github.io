The map below uses code enforcement violations and 311 complaints published by the city of Boston to visualize the accumulation of garbage during move-in week, the seven-day period surrounding Sept. 1. The map was created for [Trash City](https://jhaddadin.github.io/trashcity), my entry for Boston's 2017 Open Data Challenge. The project won first place in the data storytelling track, and also received the open source award.

Hi! I'm an investigative journalist in Massachusetts specializing in data and public records. I spend a lot of time [prying loose](http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20170302/ex-framingham-superintendent-still-receiving-salary) information and [browbeating](https://twitter.com/JimHaddadin/status/834831618690912256) public servants about the right to know.

I also experiment with [new tools](http://www.gatehousenewsroom.com/2016/02/12/stay-up-to-date-on-court-info-let-machines-do-the-hard-work/) to keep tabs on government. One of my projects uses code enforcement violations and 311 complaints to [visualize](http://jhaddadin.github.io) the impact of move-in week in Boston. You can view more of my coding projects on [Github](https://github.com/jhaddadin). You can also read my [published work](/clips/), send me an [email](mailto:jhaddadin@gmail.com), find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JimHaddadin) or view my [resume](/resume/).

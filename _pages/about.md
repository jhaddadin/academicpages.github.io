Hi! I'm a journalist in Massachusetts with a focus on data, public records and government accountability. I currently work at the MetroWest Daily News, where I cover life in the suburbs west of Boston.

Over the past decade, I've won some awards, pried loose government records and browbeaten public servants about the right to know. I've [knocked](http://www.fosters.com/article/20121016/GJNEWS_01/121019350) on the killer's door, interviewed the [grieving widower](http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/local-news/2013/12/31/memorial-event-held-in-remembrance-of-brookline-mother-of-three-who-died-christmas-eve/) and covered all manner of animal stories. One of them led to an [investigation](http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/local-news/2014/02/06/nashua-police-commissioner-pappas-resigns-apologizes-for-his-actions-after-ducks-run-over-by-david-campbell/) by the New Hampshire attorney general. A few years ago, I watched a nuclear submarine burn up in a fire. I also traced nine generations of [Scott Brown's family](http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/dec/20/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-his-family-roots-go-back-nine-gen/), sent [Mike Huckabee](http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/22/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-more-people-want-hunt-moose-new/) into a lather about [moose chili](https://www.facebook.com/mikehuckabee/posts/10151819001272869) and reported on the U.S. Army's [secret plan](http://melrose.wickedlocal.com/x795259774/In-Melrose-a-phantom-military-factory-comes-to-light) to outwit the Nazis with inflatable tanks.

Recently, I've been using computer programming to sift through data, find scoops and bring more depth to my work. I'm always experimenting with new tools to help keep tabs on state and local government. I also wrote a program to display Donald Trump's tweets inside a tiny [cardboard box](https://twitter.com/JimHaddadin/status/826895313436864516) to annoy one of my coworkers.

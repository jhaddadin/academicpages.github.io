Hi! I'm a journalist in Massachusetts with a focus on data, public records and government accountability. I currently work at the MetroWest Daily News, where I cover life in the suburbs west of Boston.

I spend a lot of time [prying loose](http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20170302/ex-framingham-superintendent-still-receiving-salary) government records and [browbeating](https://twitter.com/JimHaddadin/status/834831618690912256) public servants about the right to know. A few years ago, I watched a nuclear submarine [burn up](http://www.fosters.com/article/20120525/GJNEWS_01/705259899) in a fire. I also traced nine generations of [Scott Brown's family](http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/dec/20/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-his-family-roots-go-back-nine-gen/), sent [Mike Huckabee](http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/22/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-more-people-want-hunt-moose-new/) into a lather about [moose chili](https://www.facebook.com/mikehuckabee/posts/10151819001272869) and reported on the U.S. Army's [secret plan](http://melrose.wickedlocal.com/x795259774/In-Melrose-a-phantom-military-factory-comes-to-light) to outwit the Nazis with inflatable tanks.

Over the past decade, I've covered stump speeches, [knocked](http://www.fosters.com/article/20121016/GJNEWS_01/121019350) on killers' doors, interviewed [grieving widowers](http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/local-news/2013/12/31/memorial-event-held-in-remembrance-of-brookline-mother-of-three-who-died-christmas-eve/) and written all kinds of animal stories. One of them led to an [investigation](http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/local-news/2014/02/06/nashua-police-commissioner-pappas-resigns-apologizes-for-his-actions-after-ducks-run-over-by-david-campbell/) by the New Hampshire attorney general.

Recently, I've been using computer programming to sift through data and public records. I'm always experimenting with [new tools](http://www.gatehousenewsroom.com/2016/02/12/stay-up-to-date-on-court-info-let-machines-do-the-hard-work/) to help keep tabs on state and local government. One of my projects used code enforcement violations and 311 complaints to [visualize](http://jhaddadin.github.io) the impact of move-in week in Boston. It won two awards in the city's first Open Data Challenge.

I also wrote a program to display Donald Trump's tweets inside a tiny [cardboard box](https://twitter.com/JimHaddadin/status/826895313436864516) to annoy one of my coworkers.

You can view more of my coding projects on [Github](https://github.com/jhaddadin). You can also ready my [published work](/clips/), send me an [email](mailto:jhaddadin@gmail.com), find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JimHaddadin) or view my [resume](/cv/).
